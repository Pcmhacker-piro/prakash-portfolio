# Portfolio — Prakash Chand Meena

This is a simple static portfolio site built with HTML and CSS.

## What this is
- Personal portfolio webpage located in the `Project` folder.
- Single-page layout with sections: About, Experience, Projects, Contact.
- Styles in `index.css` and images in the `image/` folder.

## Quick start
Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder with a small static server:

```bash
# from the Project folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

Or, if you prefer another port (example used in screenshots):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3002
# open http://127.0.0.1:3002/index.html
```

## Notable changes (local edits)
- Added a "Programming Languages" / "Computer Fundamentals" block inside the `#experience` section.
- CSS adjusted so all `.experience-box` cards share the same height and align in a 2x2 grid on desktop.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `index.css` — styles
- `image/` — profile and project images

## Next steps / tips
- To make the site production-ready, consider minifying CSS and organizing assets under `assets/`.
- If hosting on GitHub Pages, ensure links are relative (they already are) and publish the repository branch.

## Live Demo (GitHub Pages)
